description: Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change (Experimental)

Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/opsx-apply add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-apply <other>`).

2. **Run the apply operation gate before mutation**

   ```bash
   npm run openspec:gate -- --operation apply --change "<name>"
   ```

   Stop on a non-zero exit. Preserve the exact gate output instead of entering the
   implementation loop with missing required artifacts.

3. **Check status to understand the schema**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, and `actionContext`: planning scope and edit constraints
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

4. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using `/opsx-continue`
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

5. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

   Read `<changeRoot>/history.md` before substantial work. If it is missing, create it with `# Strategy History` and no invented attempts. Reconcile any `Pending Strategy History` entries from compaction before continuing.

6. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

7. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Run the task's stated observable proof on the current candidate
   - Run its applicable focused validation, or record the exact reasoned manual/external gate
   - Mark the task complete only after required proof and validation pass: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Continue to next task

   **If proof or validation fails:**
   - Leave the task unchecked
   - Preserve the command, representative input, exit status, stdout/stderr, relevant logs/exceptions, side effects, and artifact paths
   - Treat the raw tool result as authoritative; never substitute an expected exit code. If only generic non-zero status is observable, record the precise process exit code as `unknown`
   - Inspect those diagnostics and continue local run-observe-correct when the failure is resolvable inside the accepted scope
   - Before another materially distinct attempt, append objective, approach, evidence, outcome, reason, do-not-repeat condition, and retry condition to `history.md`
   - After two materially similar attempts without observable progress, stop repeating and use a different causal mechanism; flags, wording, timeout, prompt details, or retry count alone are not a new strategy
   - Repeat a recorded strategy only after appending new evidence that satisfies its retry condition or invalidates the prior result
   - Pause only for an exact user-owned blocker; do not convert an ordinary failure into a routine approval question

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

8. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: report that implementation tasks are complete and archive checks are next
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

Working on task 3/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete

Working on task 4/7: <task description>
[...implementation happening...]
✓ Task complete
```

**Output On Completion**

```
## Implementation Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 7/7 tasks complete ✓

### Completed This Session
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
...

All implementation tasks have current evidence. Run `/opsx-archive` for separate sync, validation, and archive checks.
Do not emit an RC or stable claim from this command. If current runtime proof supports a lifecycle report, apply output is capped at `Development-Stage: MVP` until the separate qualification and handoff checks complete.
```

**Output On Pause (Issue Encountered)**

```
## Implementation Paused

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Progress:** 4/7 tasks complete

### Issue Encountered
<description of the issue>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update a task checkbox only after its required observable proof and focused validation pass
- Do not infer RC/stable from completed task checkboxes; this command does not complete the separate archive and stable-handoff boundary
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
